Simply open the file in an editor and type in a prefix. Ex: FZGX
The result would be a something like this:

Original file: falcon.png
Prefix       : FZGX
Resultant    : fze_FZGXfalcon_1CF35408v1.01.dat

This is useful for organizing emblems inside the F-Zero GXâ€™s emblem menu,
as it sorts them alphabetically.

WARNING: Not all characters are valid and nothing is tested at this point.
         If memory serves correct, the emblems names cannot include *, and
         likely does not accept many non-alphabetical characters.
